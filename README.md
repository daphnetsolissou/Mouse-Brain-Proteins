# Mouse-Brain-Proteins
Biotechnology Assigment

GOAL
The proposed assignment aims to advance your scientific knowledge as well as to improve your technical skills regarding the manipulation, evaluation and presentation of data obtained by -omic approaches (in this case proteomics). In contrast to traditional methodologies,          -omics technologies produce a huge amount of data that requires specialized expertise for further process and interpretation. The present work will be performed in four parts, with final delivery the design and development of a database including data from different sources as well as results obtained and published by the proteomic analysis of normal mouse brain.

1st part (date of delivery/presentation: 13/01/2021, 10 min presentation)

Comparative analysis of the results from different sources/datasets

Based on the results of the proteomic analysis of normal mouse brain (seven excel files representing different parts of the brain, already provided) you have to address the following issues:
a) Discern the common and the unique proteins regarding each mouse brain part.
b) Identify the proteins that have been previously reported in related studies (pdf files already provided) per brain part.

2nd part (date of delivery 20/01/2021, 10 min presentation)

Data evaluation

The result of the proteomic analysis will be processed according to Gene Ontology (GO) included in UNIPROT database. Specifically, the proteins included in the seven excel files must be classified according to GO.

3rd part (date of delivery 27/01/2021, 10 min presentation)

Enrich of the results with data obtained by the bibliography.

The list of the identified proteins of each brain part will be completed with the proteins identified in similar works of other research groups, as annotated in the literature


4rt part FINAL (date of delivery: WILL BE DETERMINED, 10 min presentation).

MOUSE BRAIN PROTEIN DATABASE

Construct a database, including all the above findings and final presentation.
